  Explain
  - Services: <postgresdb>
  - Environments
    # Sets environment variables for the container. In the postgres service, we are setting the POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and POSTGRES_DB variables, which are used to configure the PostgreSQL database. In the pgadmin service, we are setting the PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL and PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD variables, which are used to set the default email and password for the pgAdmin login.
  - Volumes
    # Mounts a volume (i.e., persistent storage) for the container. In the postgres service, we are mounting a volume named postgres_data at the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory, which is where the PostgreSQL data is stored. This allows the data to persist even if the container is stopped or removed.
  - Ports
    # Exposes a containerâ€™s port to the host. In the postgres service, we are exposing the default PostgreSQL port (5432) on the host. In the <pgadmin> service, we are exposing port 80 on the host.
  - Depends on
    # Specifies that a service depends on another service. In the <pgadmin> service, we are specifying that it depends on the postgres service, which means that the postgres service must be started before the <pgadmin> service.
