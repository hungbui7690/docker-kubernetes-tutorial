/*
  Run a Docker container
  - docker run node
    -> download latest node image and run it as a container
    -> then exit
  - docker ps -a
  - docker run -it node
    -> interactive mode
      # node -v


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  Image
  - existing -> via DockerHub
  - custom -> write your own Dockerfile based on another image


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  1. create Dockerfile


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  Build Image from Dockerfile
  1. docker build .
    -> return id of the image
  2. docker run <image_id>
  - localhost -> not see the website
    -> not setup port mapping

  - docker ps 
  3. docker stop <image_id>
  - docker ps -a 
  4. docker run -p 3000:80 <image_id>
    -> -p: publish
  
  - localhost:3000

  ðŸŒ² If we change the code below -> image is not reflected
    -> we need to re-build the image


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  - layer based structure
  - layers are cached


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  Avoid running "npm install" many times
  - From: 
      COPY . .
      RUN npm install

  - To: 
      COPY package.json .
      RUN npm install
      COPY . .

  - docker stop <image_id>
  - docker build .
    -> very fast
