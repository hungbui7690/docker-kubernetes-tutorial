/*
  From Manual Deployment to Managed Services
  - Automated Approach -> instead of <EC2>, we use <ECS> (Elastic Container Service)
  - For Azure -> Containers services/products are similar 
  - Benefits: 
    # create, manage, update is handled automatically
    # monitoring and scaling is simplified
